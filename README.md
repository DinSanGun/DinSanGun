# Hi there, I'm Din Yair Sadot 👋  

🚀 Software Developer | Computer Science & Philosophy Graduate, Ben-Gurion University  

## About Me  
I’m a **software developer** with a strong foundation in **computer science**, hands-on experience building **end-to-end applications**, and a deep interest in writing **clean, maintainable, and well-structured code**.

I recently graduated with a degree in **Computer Science and Philosophy** from **Ben-Gurion University**, where I developed strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a solid understanding of algorithms, systems, and software design.

Alongside my technical background, my studies in **Philosophy**—particularly Plato, Kant, and Spinoza—shaped the way I approach abstraction, correctness, and reasoning about complex systems.

Outside of tech, I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes 👨‍🍳
